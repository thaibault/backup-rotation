## Module backupRotation
This module provides generic service handling for each program supporting
standard process signals. In general you only have to replace the string
"generic" to you specific application name.

You have to install program `msmtp` to get this script working. A proper
user specific "~/.msmtprc" or global "/etc/msmtprc" have to be present on
your distribution. A sample configuration using simple gmail account to
send mails (Replace `ACCOUNT_NAME`, `ACCOUNT_E_MAIL_ADDRESS`,
`ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`, `RECIPIENT_E_MAIL_ADDRESS`):

```
defaults
auth           on
tls            on
tls_starttls   on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile        /tmp/msmtpLog

account        gmail
host           smtp.gmail.com
port           587
from           ACCOUNT_E_MAIL_ADDRESS
user           ACCOUNT_NAME@gmail.com
password       ACCOUNT_PASSWORD

account        default : gmail
```

Furthermore you should create a file "/etc/backupRotation" to overwrite the
following variables. You need to set values for
`backupRotation_source_target_mappings` at least:

```bash
declare -A backupRotation_source_target_mappings=(
["SOURCE_URL1"]="TARGET_URL1 RECIPIENT_E_MAIL_ADDRESS"
["SOURCE_URL2"]="TARGET_URL2 RECIPIENT_E_MAIL_ADDRESS ANOTHER_RECIPIENT_E_MAIL_ADDRESS"
...
)
```
